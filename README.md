# Gradient Descent

## Purpose

A project to practice and implement learned tools and strategies from Coursera Machine Learning Courses. Converting
learned concepts into C++ aswell (Work in progress).

## Project Structure

Implementations of machine learning functions will be collected completely within
gradient-descent.h located in the root folder, All needed python files will be located in their respective folder

Implementations of different learning models will be seperated by folders and implemented in python and c++ within their respective folder. To run the implementations in c++ you will need to compile the main.cpp in each folder using

`g++ -std=c++17 -Wall main.cpp`

This will then create an executable you can run with

`a.exe`

Python models can be run in the terminal using

`python main.py`

To run the respective models you will need to navigate in the terminal to their directory.
